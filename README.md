# Circuit-in-java
This repo shows how can someone represent a circuit with logic doors in java.
In all the files are some code representing one element or various elements of the circuit.
The photo circuit describes the circuit we need to representen via code. Like it's done.

The folder called docs contains the info in a website like Doxygen but for java, ilustrating the structure
of the java files, and you can navigate within those files and make like a scheme of the files, like a tree.
